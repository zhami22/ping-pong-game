Python Pong is a classic arcade Pong game written in Python using the tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface. In this game, two players control paddles to keep the ball in play and score points by making the opponent miss the ball.

üìú Game Description:

The game consists of two paddles and a ball that bounces off the walls and paddles. Each player controls their own paddle, moving it up or down to hit the ball. When the ball hits one of the walls, the opponent scores a point, and the game continues. The goal is to score more points than your opponent.

üéÆ How to Play:

Controls for Player 1 (left paddle):

W ‚Äî Move up.
S ‚Äî Move down.
Controls for Player 2 (right paddle):

Arrow Up (‚Üë) ‚Äî Move up.
Arrow Down (‚Üì) ‚Äî Move down.
Every time the ball goes out of bounds (either left or right), the player who missed the ball loses a point, and the ball respawns at the center of the screen.

The game continues until one of the players reaches a set number of points, or you manually stop the game.

üöÄ How to Run:

To run the game on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Install Python
Make sure you have Python 3.6 or a later version installed. If you don't have Python, download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install Dependencies
If you don‚Äôt have the tkinter module installed, you can install it with the following command:

For Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install python3-tk
For Windows, tkinter comes pre-installed with Python, so you don‚Äôt need to install it separately.

3. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/pythonicway-pong.git

4. Run the Game
